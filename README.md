# 36650_HW1_OOP

5 OOP Concepts:

(1) abstract class: Processor is an abstract class
(2) inheritance: Country_Processor is a Processor, State Processor is a Country_Processor, County_Processor is a State_Processor
(3) attributes and methods: State_Processor has attribute self.df and method printing()
(4) polymorphism: the method printing() overrides different classes with exact same name and attributes
(5) initializer: a parent name is called when a child initializes. When County Processor initializes, we call State_Processor
